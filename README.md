                                            Predictive Analytics Project

Overview
This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to address problem using Random Forest and advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and class imbalance handling. The project aims to achieve accurate and generalizable predictions while exploring the relationships between features and target outcomes.

Features:

1. Data Processing: Scalable preprocessing pipeline including missing value imputation, scaling, encoding, and feature transformation.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to uncover patterns and correlations.
3. Modeling: Implementation of Random Forest, hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV, and comparison with alternative models like Gradient Boosting.
4. Class Imbalance Solutions: Techniques such as SMOTE and class weighting to handle imbalanced datasets.
5. Model Validation: Metrics evaluation on test data.
6. Deployment: Model conversion to ONNX format for efficient runtime inference.
